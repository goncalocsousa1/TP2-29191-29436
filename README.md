# TP2-29191-29436 - Hacker Madness
A young hacker was proposed to make a game for a university subject. When he got home and decided to do it, he noticed his computer had some viruses. As he delved deeper into the problem, he found himself battling more than just code. The viruses were unlike anything he had ever encountered—complex, adaptive, and almost... alive. Frustrated but determined, he decided to take a break. Little did he know, this decision would change his life forever. When he returned to his computer, a strange message flashed on his screen: "WELCOME TO THE DIGITAL REALM." Before he could react, a surge of energy enveloped him, pulling him into a vortex of binary code and flashing lights. He woke up in a strange new world—inside his computer. The digital landscape was vast and filled with towering structures of data and rivers of streaming information. This was the Digital Realm, a place where viruses had evolved into monstrous entities, and the only way to survive was to use his hacking skills.
